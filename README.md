## **Introduction**  
This project is a simple **User Registration Form** that allows users to enter their **name, email, and password** and submit the information without refreshing the page. It also includes a feature to **fetch and display data** from an online source. This helps in understanding how websites handle data without making users reload the page every time they submit a form.

## **How It Works (Step by Step)**  

1️⃣ **The user enters their details** – They type their name, email, and password into the form.  

2️⃣ **The form checks if all fields are filled** – If something is missing, it asks the user to complete it.  

3️⃣ **The form sends the data** – Once everything is correct, the details are sent to an online service using AJAX.  

4️⃣ **A confirmation message appears** – The user gets a message saying that the form was submitted successfully.  

5️⃣ **The user can load more information** – By clicking a button, they can fetch extra data (like sample posts) from an online source.  

6️⃣ **The data is displayed in a table** – The fetched information is shown in a neat and organized table on the webpage.
